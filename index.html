            <h2>SUMMARY:</h2>
                <p>I have a Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Mathematics Minor. I recently completed Amazon Military Apprenticeship and am now completing the Accelerate to Consultant program. I spent the last six years before starting at Amazon Web Services serving as a Non-Commissioned Officer in Army Special Operations where I became very experienced in leadership, decision making, and operating in high pressure situations with a short timeline. My ability to learn and master the skills required for a job quickly and efficiently makes me an asset on any team.</p>
